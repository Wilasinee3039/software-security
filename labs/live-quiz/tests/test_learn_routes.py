"""tests/test_learn_routes.py — HTTP coverage for the /learn content plane.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Before it, the suite had 244 tests and **not one of them
made a request to /learn**. Everything tested `content.py`'s functions directly,
so the route layer — URL shapes, 404s, redirects, and the CSP that keeps the
Week 5 XSS payload inert — was entirely unexercised. When /learn was reshaped for
multiple courses, all 244 still passed while every URL had changed underneath.

Two things are pinned here that would otherwise fail silently and in the wrong
direction:

  * **Legacy URLs keep working.** /learn/week04-injection is what existing
    worksheets, printed handouts and anything already given to a student use. It
    must redirect, not 404.
  * **Courses are isolated.** A week directory in course A must not be readable
    through course B's URL, even though both are just directories on disk.
