assessment.py — graded weekly quizzes: publish, take, auto-grade, export.

Replaces the Google Form path in instructor/quizzes/weekly/README.md. That
README's anti-copying controls are *Form settings*; here they are server-side
invariants, which is a stronger position on every axis it lists:

    Form setting                     here
    ------------------------------   --------------------------------------------
    shuffle question order           per-student permutation frozen at attempt start
    shuffle option order             same, and answers are stored in CANONICAL index
                                     space so grading never depends on what they saw
    one question per page            `cursor` lives on the server
    disable "back"                   `cursor` is advance-only — not a browser hint
    limit 1 response per account     UNIQUE(assessment_id, student_id) + a one-time
                                     code that is burned on redemption
    collect email                    the roster's student_id IS the identity, and it
                                     is the same handle as CTFd / WireGuard / gradebook
    release scores later             `assessments.released`

The one real trade: we own the access path instead of Google. That is the point
of the exercise, not a regression.

WHAT MUST NEVER LEAK
    `correct` lives in the frozen snapshot and must not reach the client before
    submission. `question_for_student()` is the only rendering path and it does
    not carry it; `test_assessment.py` asserts that.

TIME
    Every timestamp is ISO-8601 UTC and is passed in by the caller rather than
    read from the clock here, so the whole module is testable without freezing
    time and a replayed sequence produces identical results.
