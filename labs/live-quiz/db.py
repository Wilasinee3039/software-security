# ── Migrations ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The schema files are CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS, which is idempotent for NEW
# tables and does nothing at all for a new COLUMN on an existing one. So an added
# column needs an explicit, guarded ALTER: SQLite has no ADD COLUMN IF NOT
# EXISTS, and a bare ALTER raises "duplicate column name" on the second boot.
#
# WHY course_slug IS A STRING AND NOT A FOREIGN KEY
# Courses are configured outside this database — $COURSES / the curriculum
# monorepo's courses/*.yml — because a course is an ordering over content
# directories, not a row someone maintains twice. A `courses` table here would
# be a second source of truth that drifts the first time a slug is renamed in one
# place and not the other. The write path validates the slug against the live
# course registry instead (see assessment.create_assessment /
# submission.create_assignment), so a bad value is rejected at the boundary
# rather than tolerated in storage.

    # (table, column, type) — graded artifacts must know which course they belong
    # to. Without this a teacher of several courses gets one flat list of every

# SQLite cannot bind an IDENTIFIER — `PRAGMA table_info(?)` and

# in the migration below have to be interpolated into the statement text. Every
# one of them comes from _ADDED_COLUMNS, a literal tuple three lines up, so no
# untrusted value can reach them today.
#
# "No untrusted value reaches them TODAY" is exactly the property that quietly
# stops being true — someone makes the migration list configurable, or feeds it
# a course slug, and the f-string is still sitting there. This course teaches
# students to look for precisely that shape (Week 4, Injection & Input
# Handling), so the guard is enforced here rather than asserted in a comment:
