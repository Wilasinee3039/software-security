"""
routes_assess.py — HTTP surface for the graded weekly quiz.

Registered as a blueprint by app.py. Kept out of app.py because the live game and
the graded quiz are different modes that happen to share a process: the game is
synchronous/anonymous/in-memory, this is asynchronous/identified/persisted and
its numbers become someone's grade. Mixing their routes into one 500-line module
is how the identity models get mixed up too.

Two audiences, two guards:
  * teacher routes  -> @login_required, and every query is scoped by teacher_id
                       (a teacher must never reach another teacher's assessment)
  * student routes  -> no account at all; the one-time code IS the credential,
                       exchanged once for a server-side session
