"""
submission.py — worksheet submission and rubric grading.

Replaces Google Classroom's collect-and-grade role, completing the move off
Google. Identity is the same one-time code used by the graded quiz: no student
password exists anywhere on this platform.

THE TWO THINGS THAT MAKE FILE UPLOAD SAFE HERE

1. **A student never influences a filesystem path.** `store_file` generates the
   on-disk name from `secrets.token_hex` and records the student's own filename
   in the database for display only. Traversal, collisions and
   extension-confusion (`report.pdf.php`, `..%2f`, NUL bytes, Windows reserved
   names) are all impossible by construction rather than filtered — there is no
   filter to bypass because the input never reaches the path.

2. **Uploads are never served inline.** `open_file` hands back bytes and a
   display name; the route sets `Content-Disposition: attachment` and a
   sandbox CSP. This matters more here than on most platforms: an uploaded HTML
   or SVG rendered inline from this origin is stored XSS straight into the
   teacher's authenticated grading session — the account that holds every
   student's marks. The deliverables are screenshots and PDFs, so nothing is
   lost by refusing to render them.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* DONE
   No content sniffing, no image re-encoding, no antivirus. Those are defences
   for platforms that display what they receive. This one doesn't. Adding them
   would suggest inline rendering is safe if only the checks were good enough,
   which is the argument that loses.

MARKS
   A criterion with `points = NULL` is UNMARKED, which is not zero. `score()`
   reports `complete=False` while any criterion is unmarked, so a half-graded
   worksheet cannot be exported as a finished mark.
