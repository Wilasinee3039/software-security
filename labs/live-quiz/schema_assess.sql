-- schema_assess.sql — the graded weekly-quiz tables, applied idempotently at
-- startup alongside schema.sql.
--
-- This is a DIFFERENT MODE from the live Kahoot-style game, not an extension of
-- it. The game is synchronous, anonymous and in-memory; this is asynchronous,
-- identified, persisted, and its numbers end up in someone's grade. Sharing a
-- database with the game is fine; sharing its identity model is not.
--
-- Replaces the Google Form path described in
-- instructor/quizzes/weekly/README.md. Every proctoring control that README
-- lists as a *Form setting* is a server-side invariant here — see the notes on
-- `attempts` below.

-- Roster an assessment can be assigned to. `student_id` is the SAME handle used
-- everywhere else — the CTFd username, the WireGuard peer name, the gradebook
-- row key (see instructor/roster/). Not a new identity; a reference to the
-- existing one.
-- A PERSON. `student_id` is the registrar's own identifier, so it is the natural
-- key; minting a surrogate id and then mapping back to the real one forever buys
-- nothing. See roster.py for why this replaced a table keyed (teacher_id,
-- student_id) — that shape made the same human three unrelated rows across three
-- of this instructor's courses, and had nowhere to put a co-taught course.
