/* iam-evaluation.js — Cloud Infrastructure & Security, lesson 7.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR
 * Students can recite "explicit deny wins" and still not predict a single
 * request correctly, because the sentence hides three separate ways to be
 * denied and one silent way to lose an Allow. So this walks the ORDER out loud:
 *
 *   1. an explicit Deny that matches      -> DENY, evaluation stops
 *   2. else no matching Allow             -> implicit DENY
 *   3. else                               -> ALLOW
 *
 * and it names the statement that decided, every time.
 *
 * The silent case is the one worth the build: a statement whose Action and
 * Resource both match but whose Condition does not is skipped ENTIRELY. AWS
 * returns AccessDenied and never says a Condition was the reason — which is
 * exactly what a student sees when their s3:prefix rewrite "does not work".
 *
 * DELIBERATE SIMPLIFICATIONS, stated in the page too so nobody learns them
 * wrong:
 *   - the SCP is modelled Deny-only. A real SCP is also a ceiling: without an
 *     Allow (normally FullAWSAccess) everything beneath it is denied.
 *   - the permissions boundary caps only what the IDENTITY policy grants. That
 *     is the real rule for same-account access: a resource-based policy's grant
 *     is not capped by the caller's boundary. Modelling the boundary as a gate
 *     on everything would have made this simulation over-deny, and a lecturer
 *     flipping switches live would have hit it.
 *   - single account throughout: no session policies, no VPC endpoint policies,
 *     no cross-account "both sides must allow" rule.
 *
 * Everything is computed here. No network, no storage — the page is framed
 * without allow-same-origin, so it could not use either if it wanted to.
