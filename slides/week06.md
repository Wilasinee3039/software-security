# Week 6
## Authentication, Sessions & Access Control
Software Security · Nutthakorn Chalaemwongwan

<!-- Hook: change /orders/1 to /2 and read a stranger's data — promise that demo. The #1 web risk in 2025 is Broken Access Control, and it's mostly missing one check. ~2 min. -->

---

## Today

- Authn vs authz
- Session management & JWT pitfalls
- OAuth2 / OIDC at a glance
- IDOR & broken access control
- 🎮 Game: **IDOR Treasure Hunt + JWT Forgery**

<!-- Roadmap, 1 min. This is the last teaching week before review/midterm — flag that. Lab = exploit IDOR + forge a JWT, then implement RBAC + proper verification. -->

---

## Recap — Week 5

- XSS steals sessions → today we manage them
- Client-side trust is limited — enforce on the server

<!-- 1-min bridge. XSS could steal a session token; today: what IS that token, and how do we stop theft + misuse? Theme of the week: enforce on the server, every request. -->

---

## Authn vs Authz

- **Authentication** — *who are you?* (login, MFA)
- **Authorization** — *what are you allowed to do?*
- Most breaches today are **authz** failures
- Maps to **A01 Broken Access Control**, **A07 Authentication Failures**

<!-- The distinction students most often blur — make them repeat it. Authn = identity; authz = permission. A01 is #1 in OWASP 2025 precisely because authz checks get forgotten. Ask for an example of each failing. ~5 min. -->

---

## Sessions

- Server issues a session token after login
- Classic pattern: stored in a cookie (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`)
- Risks: fixation, predictable IDs, **no expiry**, no logout invalidation
- **Today's lab is 100% JWT bearer-token — no cookies at all.** Of these four risks, only "no expiry" is what you'll actually exercise (the fix adds a 15-min `exp` claim); fixation/predictable-ID/logout-invalidation are cookie-session concepts, general knowledge, not tested here

<!-- Connect cookie flags to W5: HttpOnly stops XSS theft, SameSite stops CSRF, Secure forces HTTPS. Be upfront that this lab doesn't touch cookies — don't let students expect a cookie-based task today. Explain session fixation briefly (attacker sets the id before login) as general knowledge. ~5 min. -->

---

## JWT pitfalls

- `alg: none` accepted → forge any token
- Weak/guessable HMAC secret → re-sign
- Not checking `exp` / `aud` / signature at all
- Sensitive data in payload (it's only base64!)

```sim
jwt-forge
```

<!-- The sim IS the "decode a JWT live" demo — edit the payload, watch base64url decode instantly (not encrypted), then flip alg to none and watch a server that trusts the header accept it. Emphasize: never put secrets in the payload. This is the JWT Forgery game, live. ~7 min. -->

---

## OAuth2 / OIDC (high level)

- Delegated access via tokens — don't share passwords
- OIDC adds identity (ID token) on top of OAuth2
- Common bugs: open redirect, missing state, token leakage

<!-- Keep high-level (full OAuth is its own course). Key idea: "Login with Google" = delegation, you never give the app your Google password. The `state` parameter prevents CSRF on the callback. ~4 min. -->

---

## IDOR & broken access control

```text
GET /api/orders/1   → your order
GET /api/orders/2   → someone else's  😱
```

- Object reference with no ownership check
- Vertical (become admin) vs horizontal (other users)

<!-- The worked example — this is the IDOR Treasure Hunt. The server authenticated you but never checked the object BELONGS to you. Horizontal = peer data; vertical = privilege escalation. ~6 min. -->

---

## One request, two gates

![One HTTP request must pass two gates. Gate 1, authentication: verify the token's signature and algorithm — broken by alg:none and a weak hardcoded secret, so a forged token passes. Gate 2, authorization: does the caller own THIS object — broken because the ownership check never runs. The key point: even a perfectly valid, genuine token clears Gate 1 but must not be enough to clear Gate 2 on its own — alice's own valid login token can still read bob's order if Gate 2 is missing.](img/authn-vs-authz.svg)

<!-- The thesis of the whole week, made concrete: JWT pitfalls broke Gate 1, IDOR broke Gate 2, and they're independent failures — fixing one doesn't fix the other. This is why "Defenses" lists both "verify JWT" and "check ownership" as separate bullets, not one fix. ~4 min. -->

---

## Access control models

- **MAC** — Mandatory: system-enforced labels (military)
- **DAC** — Discretionary: owner grants access (file perms)
- **RBAC** — Role-Based: permissions via roles
- **RuBAC** — Rule-Based: conditions (time of day, IP)

> Best practices: separation of duties · least privilege · implicit deny

<!-- Quick taxonomy — general knowledge. Today's lab does NOT implement RBAC/ABAC: the actual fix is a flat ownership check (`order["owner"] != user`), no roles or permissions structure at all. Don't tell students they'll build RBAC today; they won't. Stress the three best-practice principles — especially implicit deny (default to no access). ~4 min. -->

---

## Exercise — RBAC

| Role | Permissions |
|---|---|
| Developer | Read/write Git, JIRA, run unit tests |
| QA Engineer | Read Git, write test reports, JIRA, **deploy to staging** |
| Project Manager | Read Git, JIRA, view dashboard |
| Intern | Read Git, run unit tests |

1. Who may deploy to staging?
2. An intern must create bug entries — which role's perms to add?
3. List all roles that can modify the codebase.

<!-- Run this interactively — give 2 minutes, then poll answers. (1) QA only. (2) add JIRA-write, narrowly (least privilege, not a full role bump). (3) Developer (write Git); discuss whether QA's staging deploy counts. ~6 min. -->

## Reading the attack in the logs

Reconstruct the kill chain from Apache logs:

```text
GET /login.php?username=' or 1=1 limit 1; -- a&...   302   ← SQLi admin
POST /upload.php                                     200   ← backdoor
GET /uploads/backdoor.php?cmd=ls%20-l                200   ← RCE
```

- `%20` = space (URL-decode!) · logs let you trace what happened

<!-- Ties W4 (SQLi auth bypass + upload→RCE) into incident response. Walk the three lines as a story: get in → plant webshell → run commands. Teach URL-decoding (%20=space). Defenders read logs; attackers leave them. ~5 min. -->

---

## CWE mapping

- **CWE-639** — IDOR / missing ownership check
- **CWE-347** — improper signature verification (`alg:none` forgery)
- **CWE-321** — use of a hardcoded/weak cryptographic key (the guessable HMAC secret)

<!-- Reference for the worksheet — these three are what's actually graded (worksheet header + Q1). CWE-321 is easy to drop since it's not the "obvious" JWT CWE, but it's the weak-secret task's specific id. ~1 min. -->

---

## Defenses

- **Server-side authorization on every request** (deny by default)
- Check ownership, not just authentication
- Strong session tokens + proper expiry/rotation
- Verify JWT signature, `alg`, `exp`, `aud`; keep secrets strong
- RBAC / ABAC enforced centrally
- **Centralize** the check — don't scatter `if role==...` everywhere

<!-- The payoff. #1: authorize EVERY request, deny by default. "Check ownership, not just authentication" is the IDOR fix in one line. Centralize so you can't forget a check on one endpoint. ~6 min. -->

---

## Tool — Burp Suite workflow

| Tool | Use |
|---|---|
| **Proxy** | intercept & modify requests |
| **Repeater** | replay/tweak one request |
| **Intruder** | automate brute-force/fuzz |
| **Decoder/Comparer** | encode payloads / diff responses |

- Set **scope**, intercept, change a value (e.g. `price=1`), forward
- Test auth, sessions, **IDOR**, privilege escalation

<!-- Practical — they'll use Repeater to tweak object ids and Intruder to enumerate. Demo: intercept, change orders/1→2, forward, see another user's data. Set scope first so you don't attack out-of-bounds. ~5 min. -->

---

## 🗺️ Game — IDOR Treasure Hunt + JWT Forgery

1. Tamper object IDs to reach **another user's** data (horizontal — become "bob," not admin) → each secret = a flag
2. Forge a weak JWT two ways: `alg:none`, then crack the hardcoded HMAC secret
3. **Defend:** switch to `solution_app.py` (already fixed), prove it blocks all three attacks (403 + two 401s), cite the exact fix line for each

<!-- Explain before lab. Treasure hunt = enumerate ids for per-student flags — it's horizontal privilege escalation (become another regular user), not vertical (become admin); /api/admin exists in the code but no graded task ever targets it, don't imply it does. Defend is read-and-cite against a pre-written fix, not student-authored RBAC — nothing here is role-based. ~3 min. -->

---

## Lab steps

> 📋 **Worksheet 6** — `labs/week06-authn-authz/worksheet.md` (Part 3) · **kickoff:** `docker compose up` → http://localhost:8080

1. Find IDOR endpoints; enumerate other users' objects
2. Crack/forge a weak JWT (`alg:none` AND the weak HMAC secret — two separate graded attacks)
3. Switch to `solution_app.py`; re-test: access denied
4. Cite the exact line that fixes each of the three attacks

<!-- Logistics. Steps 3-4 (verify the defense + cite the fix) graded — no student-authored fix code in this lab, the fix is handed to them already written. Q6 of the quiz asks for the object id they used + the fix + their personal flag. Also the NoteVault project access-control task. -->

---

## Deliverable

- IDOR + JWT findings with impact
- Citation of the fix lines in `solution_app.py` for all three attacks
- Proof the forged token / cross-user access now fails
- **+ Audit the AI / EiPE / Prompt Problem** (see worksheet)

<!-- Before/after + proof — "citation," not "you wrote a fix": the correct app is provided pre-written. AI-resilient tasks count. -->

---

## Key takeaways

- Authenticate once, **authorize every request**
- Never trust client-supplied IDs or tokens blindly
- Deny by default

<!-- Recap. Cold-call: "we authenticated the user — why can they still read another user's order?" (no ownership/authz check). ~2 min. -->
